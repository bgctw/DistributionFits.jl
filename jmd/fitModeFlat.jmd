# Specify a logitnormal distribution by mode

The logitnormal distribution is bimodal for larger values of spread parameter $\sigma$.
The goal is to find the distribution by location of the mode, $m$, and the constraints

- having only a single mode
- maximum possible $\sigma$.

The mode is located at the transcendental equation (Frederic and Lad 2008), which
indicates that all possible $\mu$, $\sigma$ combinations reside on a line with 
slope $2 \sigma^2$ passing the logit function at $m$.

$$
logit(x) = \sigma^2(2x − 1) + \mu
$$

The solution is the steepest line that does not cross the logit curve. This line
is tangent to the logit curve at the some yet unknown point $x_t$, in (0, 0.5) for $m > 0.5$.

```julia; echo = false
using StatsPlots, StatsFuns, Distributions, LogitNormals
x = range(0.0,1.0,91)[2:90]	# plotting grid
logitx = logit.(x)
m = 0.9
d = fit_mode_flat(LogitNormal, m)
plot(x, logitx, label = "logit(x)", legend = :topleft)
flinex = x -> d.σ^2*(2*x-1)+d.μ
flinex.([0,1])
plot!([0,1],flinex.([0,1]), label = "σ²(2x-1)+μ")
vline!([m], color=:lightgray, label = nothing)
```

Hence we have the following constraints, uniquely determining $x_t$, $\sigma$, and $\mu$.

- Crossing logit at $m$:  
    $logit(m) = \sigma^2(2m − 1) + \mu$
- Touching logit at $x_t$:  
    $logit(x_t) = \sigma^2(2x_t − 1) + \mu$
- Same slope at $x_t$:  
    $logit'(x_t) = 2 \sigma^2$

The same slope constraint translates to a relation between $x_t$ and $m$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
{1 \over x_t} + {1 \over 1-x_t} &= \frac{logit(m) - logit(x)}{m-x_t} 
\\
{m-x_t \over x_t} + {m-x_t \over 1-x_t} &= logit(m) - logit(x_t)
\\
{m \over x_t} + {m-1 \over 1-x_t} &= logit(m) - logit(x_t) 
\end{aligned}
$$

Analytically solving for $x_t$ is complicated by $x_t$ occuring outside and
inside the logit function. However, we can use
the constraint to determine $x_t$ by numerical optimization, minimizing the
difference between the right and the left hand side.

- $\sigma^2 = {1 \over 2} \left( {1 \over x_t} + {1 \over 1-x_t} \right)$
- $\mu = logit(m) - \sigma^2(2m − 1)$
This derivation assumed $m > 0.5$. 

For $m = 0.5$, $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{2}$.

For $m < 0.5$, one can solve the case $m_r = 1 - m$ and report negated $\mu$ because $(1-X) \sim Logitnormal(-\mu, \sigma^2)$.
The following figute displays the density of the most flat, 
i.e. widest distribution with mode at 0.9.

```julia; echo = false
plot(d, legend=:topleft, label = "logitnormal($(round(d.μ,sigdigits=3)),$(round(d.σ, sigdigits=3)))", ylab="probability density")
vline!([0.9], color=:gray, label = nothing)
```
